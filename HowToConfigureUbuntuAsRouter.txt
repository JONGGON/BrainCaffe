First, you need to prepare Server Computor as router and other guest coms.
We will configure closed network.
In ours, we use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Server one and others too for slaves
(There is not to do in slaves. just make sure wire connectings each other.)

The master info (using as router)
enp0s25 address 203.249.88.241
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 203.249.88.254
        
enp32s0 address 192.168.0.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        
To set static ip, we need to set network interface
and add below lines into file bottom
$ sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
 
+auto enp32s0
+iface enp32s0 inet static
+address 192.168.0.1
+netmask 255.255.255.0

and apply what you set, restart network.
$ service networking restart
or
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
it goes same thing.

Now, we gonna do IPRouting! 
we need to uncomment below line to use iprouting.

$ sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf

 28 net.ipv4.ip_forward=1     (Make it avtivate)
Finshed, save and out.

Then, to enable IP masquerading, enter following set of commands.
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s25 -j MASQUERADE
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp32s0 -o enp0s25 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp0s25 -o enp32s0 -j ACCEPT

Restart Your Network.

Now You have just done configuring master as router.
Enjoy!
